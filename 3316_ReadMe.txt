Getting Started with JUCE,
 by Martin Robinson, 

Code Bundle



Chapter 1 doesn't have code.

The code provided in this bundle mirrors the examples developed throughout the book. You may wish to check as you work through the chapters that your work is correct by looking at these examples. The project names match those provided throughout the book.

Unless you wish to modify the Introjucer projects, this code bundle directory needs to be placed in a particular location relative to the 'juce' directory. In fact it needs to be in the same parent directory. This allows the IDE project files to find all of the common JUCE code

For example, the first few levels of your main directory structure should look similar to the following:


MyDocuments/
| juce/
| | amalgamation/
| | docs/
| | extras/
| | juce_amalgamated.cpp
| | juce_amalgamated.h
| | juce_amalgamated.mm
| | juce.h
| | modules/
| | README.txt
| 3316OS_CodeBundle/
| | 3316_02_Codes/
| | 3316_02_Codes/
| | 3316_02_Codes/
| | 3316_02_Codes/
| | 3316_ReadMe.txt
